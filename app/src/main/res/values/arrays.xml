        <item>Upon his death, you swore that once finished, you would not hesitate in bringing its full force to bear on the society that shunned your genius. And to what end, you might ask? </item>

        <item>To take over the world with a creature of mass destruction, obviously!</item>

Also, your cloud bed is ridiculously comfy. </item>

        <item>You live in opulent decadence within the presidential palace. This is the president of the <i>WORLD</i>, mind you. Though your official title is that of adviser, you essentially have de facto control of pretty much everything.

Want to sit back and let things run themselves while monkey butlers bring you Maker\'s 46 and a Meat Lovers pizza? Sure thing, boss. Oh, and Elon Musk and you are pretty much like BFFs.\n\nThis is the pinnacle of the <i>earthly</i> realm.</item>
        <item>You live in enviable luxury within the White House, in special wing having been built just for you. Ostensibly constructed for security and privacy, it mainly serves to keep the sounds and smells of your daily depravities from civilized political discourse.\n\nThough your official title is that of adviser, you essentially have de facto control of the president and most legislators through your army of lawyers, venal politicos and dark money. Granted, you still have to contend with other silly, under-equipped nations trying to assert their economic and political interests, but they usually back down once you stage a few low-key assassinations and kidnappings. Not <i>too</i> shabby. </item>
        <item>You live in a palace of luxury that makes the Versailles of old look like a rat trap hotel, and even the most opulent Saudi princes glare upward enviously at your unprecedented holdings.\n\nYou possess an impressive makeup of lawyers, venal politicos and dark money that are happy to do your bidding, though you lack any nominal authority on the government\'s behalf. All the better, you tell yourself, because who wants to explain to some military bureaucrat why you had the mayor of your rural hometown splayed on a spitfire for some minor injustice 40 years ago?.</item>
        <item>You live in an chateau fortress along the French Riviera, several dozen homes and residents being demolished for the purpose. One of the displaced 90-year old double war veterans put up a fuss, but you had him tossed in a well.\n\nYou possess a respectable contingent of lawyers, venal politicos and dark money that can be utilized in strategic bursts for personal gain, like when you decided that Larry David wasn\'t making enough time for you.\n\nYou are able to wield power in a limited, mostly self-serving fashion, but you tell yourself that really is for the better, because who needs the kind of noise that comes with real power?</item>
        <item>You live in a giant medieval castle, imported from the Castle District in France just for your benefit and situated on the block where your former childhood bully, Sven, now lives with his three unseemly children and failing marriage. No, he hasn\'t suffered enough.\n\nYou possess a small cadre of lawyers, venal politicos and dark money that are able to extract any goods or services you may require, in addition to intimidating or \"disappearing\" persistent nuisances. You are an untouchable force in your own right, though lack the necessary clout to say, force the movie theatre across the way to show your recently completed indie film, <i>\"Dreams of a Better Tomorrow.\"</i> </item>


        <item>You live in a respectable, well-appointed mansion in the heart of Beverly Hills. It\'s a bit stuffy and bougie, to be sure, but you did meet an affable entrepreneur named Karen who has generously brought you into her multi-level marketing business. You possess a few high-priced lawyers on retainer, and can occasionally call in a favor from some big-wig in Washington, D.C. to create or eliminate a problem, but for the most part are excluded from the power game. Still, you feel your dad would be proud if whatever ethereal plane got stuck with him managed to cure his terrifying psychopathy.</item>
        <item>You live in a modern, professionally managed two-bedroom apartment in Hollywood Hills. Sure, it overlooks an encampment of meth addicts and there\'s a constant dripping sound that you just <i>can\'t</i> locate, but at least you finally have a bit of fresh, glass pipe infused air.\n\nYou possess one high-priced personal attorney to fend off any future litigation, a couple of respectable legislators on your payroll, and just enough clout to bypass the zoning authorities when you want to expand your outdoor collection of flayed squirrel art. Though you lack any world-dominating power, you are free to indulge in the life of a hedonist of old. Heck, did you know they didn\'t even have digital thermostats back then?</item>
        <item>You live in a sparse, yet clean studio apartment in the up-and-coming neighborhood of Inglewood, California. It\'s just slightly bigger than your first place right after college, only this time it comes with a stove instead of a hot plate. Saul Goodman returns your calls at his convenience, and is just effective enough to keep the barrage of property damage and wrongful death lawsuits off your back.\n\nYour influence has waned to essentially zero, having exhausted most of your resources to avoid the worst of the backlash against your failed coup on civilized society. Who\'d have thunk that attempting to enslave 7.5 billion people was a sore spot?</item>
        <item>You live in huge, dilapidated warehouse, makeshift converted into 18 tiny rooms shared by 54 people. They are struggling artists all, from Mickel who makes Scorsese-length claymation period pieces out of Playdough, to Meghan who dresses her feet up like endangered species while her fingers guns hunt them. You are the exception, of course, with the only obvious upside being you have quite a long time to figure out exactly what went wrong in your life. \n\nYou are bled dry of resources, having exhausted them to avoid the worst of the backlash against your attempted coup on civilized society. You have several thousand civil suits against you ranging from destruction of a national treasure to the wrongful death of a school bus full of nuns. You know what they say about blood and turnips, though. Speaking of which, Mickel is making dinner again. </item>
        <item>You live in a damp, moldy bachelor pad in South Los Angeles, nestled underneath the loudest part of the 110 Freeway. Your wallet and influence are bled beyond dry, but it is not enough to fend off the thousands of lawsuits and millions of people out for your blood. The only thing that keeps you out of chains is a last-minute deal struck with an orange devil who really took a liking to your disdain for progressive humanity, capricious decision making and collection of red hats.</item>

        <item>Your place of residence is split between a transitory homeless dormitory and a gutted Chevy Astro van that is still not paid off. If you ignore the bedbugs, roaches, mice and ghosts, the dormitory is definitely the more comfortable of the two abodes, though you are convinced a Nurse Ratched doppelganger keeps stealing your shoes when you are asleep.\n\nThe Monster Beverage Company, purveyors of such popular drinks as Monster Energy, have in their capitalistic pity given you a minor spokesperson gig. Though the pay is decent, the majority is garnished to pay for the innumerable civil lawsuits levied against you, and this will not end until you are dead.\n\nYou will never know peace in your lifetime.</item>
        <item>You live in a 1974 Ford Pinto that cannot turn left. Fortunately, three right turns and you\'re pretty much there. Your meager collection of belongings would make a Dust Bowl indigent weep, and definitely does the same to you.\n\nThe pittance of government cheese you collect is garnished at a usurious 98\%, leaving you just enough for a twice-daily repast of Costco hot dogs and Ikea Swedish meatballs. The civil judgements against you will not abate in your lifetime, and occasionally, despite the tinted windows, an angry person will recognize you and you have to three-turn it out of there.\n\n\This is your ending. </item>
        <item>You live under a bridge in the Miserable District, an inspired name given to the up and coming, down and crumbling ruins of halcyon American industry. Its denizens are a quirky bunch, ranging the gamut from down-on-their-luck self-proclaimed sophistcants to schizophrenic twelve-man fighty gangs.\n\nAny time you manage to get more than \$50 on you, your debtor\'s ankle bracelet goes off and within minutes a couple of bored looking federal drones show up to shake you down for it. By conservative estimates, your arrears from the barrage of civil suits and damage judgements against you should be clear in no time at all. To be clear, that means they will never be clear.\n\nIt could be worse, right?</item>
        <item>You live in a trash can by the docks. Which docks? Like, really, what does it matter? What would you even do with that information?\n\nOn a good day, the local eateries deposit a treasure trove of well-seasoned and non-spoiled meats for you to gorge on. On a bad day, which is all of them, you get open market offal and doggy poo bags. You owe millions in civil lawsuits for damages, and every time someone feels pity enough to hand you a few bucks, it gets snatched by the homeless guard hired by the government to pay down the balance.</item>
        <item>You live in a parallel dimension full of what you assume to be demons. I mean, they sort of look like what some artistic representations show demons to be, but everything kind of looks like something.\n\nThey like to poke you. They like to prod you. Their especial favorite is doing both at once while sitting on your face. On their equivalent of Sundays, you get flayed on a spitfire and somehow survive to repeat the little charade for what you assume is at least your lifetime, if not eternity.\n\nWhat a time to be alive. </item>
