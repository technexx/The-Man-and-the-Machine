    <string name="end_poem">Can death be sleep, when life is but a dream,\nAnd scenes of bliss pass as a phantom by?\nThe transient pleasures as a vision seem,\nAnd yet we think the greatest pain\'s to die.\n\nHow strange it is that man on earth should roam,

    <string name="bad_fire">Gads! Though it harnesses the power of a trillion PowerPoint lasers, the incinerator cannot quite seem to eat through the hodgepodge of metals, fabric, and synthetic skin that constitute this wretched creation. The smoke and smell of charred resins is fast becoming untenable in your precisely ventilated lair, and you must act quickly to remedy this.\n\nYou can either seal the incinerator and vent the outputs, which would unleash a very noticeable plume party of toxic vapors into the air, or take care of the problem the old fashion way, with a chainsaw and elbow grease. </string>
    <string name="fire_choice_one">Vent the incinerator</string>
    <string name="fire_choice_two">Get your hands dirty</string>
    <string name="fire_one_result">You flip a set of switches, sealing the incinerator\'s titanium doors and fully venting its outward bound exhausts. Though a potentially fatal danger is averted, you can practically feel the prying gaze of the outside world upon you. </string>
    <string name="fire_two_result">Not content to advertise your devious machinations to the world, you grab a Ne\'er-de-Break chainsaw and proceed to "get hacking," as the kids would say. Manual labor has never been your strong suit, and the task proceeds at a maddeningly difficult pace.\n\nWhen the failed creation is at last sufficiently sliced into flammable pieces, you are left exhausted and not a little bit unstrung.</string>
    <string name="fire_one_result_two">Alas, with the eyes of the world upon you already, there is precious little further attention that an extra ton of poisonous clouds will invite. This bit of salience is as disquieting as it is dire, and you are none the better for it. </string>

    <string name="upgrade_complete">The very walls quake as %1$s scream painful deaths, %2$s cry with tormented agony, and the blood of purity incarnate is spilt like so much spoiled milk. At last, The %3$s hums brighter and stronger.</string>

    <string name="str_upgrade_text">Stronger, tougher, more muscular! No longer will your creation be relegated to the weakest of the weak. It will, at the very least, rise above the dregs of the abomination food chain.</string>
    <string name="dex_upgrade_text">If being burnt in the sad space between inertia and sentience can teach one anything, it is how to move faster than an uphill rolling sloth. Your creation will be guaranteed a minimum speed and agility. </string>
    <string name="temp_upgrade_text">A constant state of rejection has been found, in adolescents, to contribute to an array of maladaptive traits and behaviors, not the least of which is general intelligence. Luckily for you, your abomination-in-training is not an adolescent. It will be assured a base level of emotional stability.</string>
    <string name="obed_upgrade_text">One would assume that continuous deaths by countless licks of flame would engender a state of contempt, at best. Fortunately, the laws of causal personality inheritance are the least egregious being broken in this place, and as such your creation can now enjoy a permanent state of not-all-consuming-truculence.</string>
    <string name="char_upgrade_text">Though general beauty is in the eye of the beholder, manufactured beauty is the only horse a savvy gambler puts money on. By the time your abomination goes forth to conquer the world, you hope that it will be so charming that none will notice the hideous assortment of unholy bits that makes up its component parts. At the very least, you can ensure it does not terrify the elderly until it\'s ready.</string>

    <string name="end_obed_success">Cattle prods, dazzling rhetoric and abject begging, oh my! You are able to persuade the creature to be more receptive to your wishes.</string>
    <string name="end_obed_failure">Don\'t sell the farm just yet, Wilbur. You fumble over your arguments, and physical coercion is met with a dead stare. The creature remains unpersuaded.</string>
    <string name="end_obed_failure_two">Years of near total isolation and a natural penchant for misanthropy and dour disposition have left you the persuasive skills of a bubonic rat. The creature is not amused, and becomes even more obstinate in reaction to your bumbling oratory attempts.</string>
    <string name="end_obed_failure_three">Perhaps talking smack about the creature\'s mom, as nonsensical and sort of self-deprecating as it is, is not the best course of action. The creature is pushed over the edge and attacks!</string>
    <string name="end_obed_decline">You bow to humility, choosing the safer course.</string>

    <string name="vocalist_good">As it belts out a tune for the ages, the lovely melodic symphony of your creature\'s voice is soothing on your frazzled nerves.  </string>
    <string name="vocalist_bad">The creature lets loose with a barrage of cacophonous wails, plaguing your already frazzled nerves. </string>
    <string name="reiki_good">The creature\'s internal mastery of mysticism has it exude a calming presence, which is passed onto you.</string>
    <string name="reiki_bad">The creature doesn\'t quite \"get\" the gist of mysticism, and the stressful internal struggle exudes an unnerving energy, which passes on to you.</string>
    <string name="berserk_good">The creature retains a masterful control of its pent up demons, and is stronger than it first appears. </string>
    <string name="berserk_bad">The creature retains poor control of its inner demons, and will be prone to wiley, spastic outbursts that hurt its dexterity.</string>
    <string name="swoll_good">The creature has emerged with way more muscle mass than anticipated, and this extra buffness will aid its overall strength.</string>
    <string name="swoll_bad">The creature has cultivated all the wrong muscle groups in great disproportion, and these unwieldy appendages will server to hinder its overall dexterity.</string>
    <string name="talker_good">The creature happily accepts a rusty copper figurine that might be Jesus, and a pile of Steel Reserve bottle caps. It purrs with increased devotion.</string>
    <string name="talker_bad">The creature apparently watched several seasons of <i>Entourage</i> in the metallic womb, and is unhappy about doing your bidding without pay.</string>
    <string name="buoyant_good">The creature has an extra bounce in its step that will aid its overall dexterity.</string>
    <string name="buoyant_bad">The creature is, as the kids say, a spaz. Its uncontrolled bouncy buoyancy will hinder its overall dexterity.</string>
    <string name="biblio_good">Your creature\'s constant of perusal of high brow literature in the womb has boosted its overall intelligence.</string>
    <string name="biblio_bad">Unfortunately, all of the <i>National Enquirer</i> and <i>Weekly World News</i> absorbed in the womb has made your creature quite a bit dumber.</string>
    <string name="exhibit_good">The creature is simply glad for the opportunity to be seen, and you can tell it is thankful to you.</string>
    <string name="exhibit_bad">The creature is vexed that despite the attention it will be getting, the expedition is clearly about you, and it you can tell it resents you for that.</string>

    <string name="zero_endurance">Alas, your crusty husk that at the best of times resembles an anemic scarecrow has reached the threshold of no return. With barely the strength to wipe the spittle from your droopy jowls, let alone continue to operate a mechanical sophisticant of this magnitide, it appears all is lost.\n\nBut wait! The Auto-Compiler! Oh, dad, you did think of everything. Except for your child\'s emotional needs, but that is of no importance now. The Auto-Compiler will, at a specified point in time, release your creature into the world without supervision. Quick - before the narcoleptic rash flares up again - pick a day! </string>

    <string name="zero_endOne">Tomorrow!</string>
    <string name="zero_endTwo">Two days hence!</string>
    <string name="zero_endThree">Three, three, three!</string>
    <string name="zero_endOneResult">Why wait for more things to go wrong? Before the warm embrace of nap time sets in, you set the compiler to launch your madness into the world. </string>
    <string name="zero_endTwoResult">Not too hot and not too cold. This temporal porridge is just right! Before the warm embrace of nap time sets in, you set the compiler to launch your madness into the world.</string>
    <string name="zero_endTThreeResult">You aren\'t a former member of Forbes\' 100 Wealthiest Mad Scientists for nothing - you like to get your value\'s worth from things. Three days it will be! Before the warm embrace of nap time sets in, you set the compiler to launch your madness into the world. </string>
    <string name="zero_endWait">As you flit in and out of consciousness, your Auto-Compiler attempts to create another monstrosity. Whatever it is, however, will soon be turned into a smoldering wreck. Not the best design on this thing, huh? Rather wasteful, I would say. </string>
    <string name="zero_endWaitTwo">Another woozy day, another wasted creature…</string>
    <string name="zero_endLaunch">The day is here! You\'ve managed to prop yourself up against one of your less jagged vertical surfaces, watching with deep trepidation as your Auto-Compiler does its super sophisticated thing.\n\nAt last, a final iteration of your creature is formed! This will have to be the one.</string>
    <string name="zero_end_nextDay">Fade into you…</string>

    <string name="zero_san">Oh, dear. You have reached the point where your insanity is no longer the playful <i>One Flew Over the Cuckoo\'s Nest</i> kind, but rather the catching-and-impaling-rodents-together-in-a-bid-to-create-a-super-rodent kind. See the difference?\n\nNo longer can you comprehend the complexity of the machine in front of you. Rather, it is a jumble of levels, symbols, and stale meatloaf.</string>
    <string name="zero_san_injection">It seems much more fun to inject the liquid into yourself, and though this gives your skin a healthy green glow, it does little to advance your understanding of this whole mess.</string>


    <string name="zero_anon">Sadly, you have made such a ruckus during this whole ordeal that if the word \"incognito\" had not won you the 4th grade spelling bee, no one would believe you knew its meaning.\n\nWith no anonymity left, the brass are knocking down your door. Your options are limited. Perhaps some money slipped under the door would grease a few palms?</string>
    <string name="anon_zero_yes">Sure. What\'s left to lose?</string>
    <string name="anon_zero_no">Ah, forget it. What\'s the point?</string>
    <string name="amon_zero_noBribe">Yielding to despair, you let fate do its thing.\n\nYour door is blown to bits and lasers point at all your parts. With not even a failed creation to act as leverage, you make for a sorry target indeed, and this particular band of ruffians does not like prisoners. You are dead.</string>
    <string name="anon_bribe_success">You scrounge up as much cash, credit chips and bank numbers as you can while under the literal gun and stuff them through the sealed laboratory equivalent of a mail slot, hoping it does the trick.\n\nAfter a few moments, your Zoom-O surveillance system shows all the scary people sauntering out, but not before their leader looks into the camera and mouths, \"We\'ll be back.\" Thanks, Arnie. You\'ve bought yourself another day, tops.</string>
    <string name="anon_bribe_failure">You scrounge up as much cash, credit chips and bank numbers as you can while under the literal gun and stuff them through the sealed laboratory equivalent of a mail slot, hoping it does the trick.\n\nYour Zoom-O surveillance system shows the scary people happily stuffing your wealth into their heavily-pocketed military uniforms. Their leader then looks up at the camera, grins a shining set of veneers, and proceeds to flip you off. It appears your bribe has not worked.\n\nYour door is blown to bits and lasers point at all your parts. With not even a failed creation to act as leverage, you make for a sorry target indeed, and this particular band of ruffians does not like prisoners. You are dead.</string>


    <string name="anon_bribe_broke">Unfortunately, you just don\'t have enough worth taking.\n\nYour door is blown to bits and lasers point at all your parts. With not even a failed creation to act as leverage, you make for a sorry target indeed, and this particular band of ruffians does not like prisoners. You are dead.</string>

    <string name="anon_bribe_dead">Your door is blown to bits and lasers point at all your parts. With not even a failed creation to act as leverage, you make for a sorry target indeed, and this particular band of ruffians does not like prisoners.\n\nYou are dead. </string>

    <string name="wealth_zero">With no money to pay for daily essentials, you are forced to pawn off some of your machine\'s components. Sad.</string>

    <!--Strings for daily creature rolls-->
    <string name="daily">The day is long, and the night longer still. At last it comes - the moment of illumination! The %1$s on the %2$s %3$s, indicating <i>something</i> is being %4$s. After what feels like an eternity, %5$s can be heard, and the object of creation flickers into sight.</string>

    <!--Choice Events. Run cases 0-9-->
    <string name="choice_one">Gadzooks! A %1$s %2$s %3$s from %4$s. Checking the readouts, you are informed the %5$s is %6$s.\n\nThe terribly esoteric nature of the beast and the rarity of parts precludes a guaranteed fix, and your options are limited. You may be able to divert enough resources toward repairing the errant system, though that will likely damage the %7$s instead.
    </string>
    <string name="choice_two">A %1$s %2$s %3$s from %4$s. Dear Jobeker! It seems that both the %5$s and %6$s are %7$s. Much like Solomon of old, you must decide who lives and who dies.</string>
    <string name="choice_three">Normally, it\'s considered good scientific practice to throw as much power into whatever one is working on without regard to consequence. In this particular case though, it may have backfired.\n\nAbnormal levels of %1$s currents are detected racing down the %2$s. This excessive energy will certainly damage the %3$s if it continues. You could divert the electrical flow into %4$s, though the energy surge will not be subtle and will likely draw attention to your evil doings.
    </string>
    <string name="choice_five">It\'s feeding time! All of your machine components require a very special diet of plutonium, anthrax, asbestos, and organic non-pasteurized milk. Unfortunately, you forgot to order enough for the whole family. One of your parts will have to go without, and that will not fare well for it.</string>
    <string name="choice_four">%1$s You\'ve dropped your %2$s pills in the %3$s of the %4$s. Trying to extricate the spiked bottle (why is it spiked?) with the only object immediately available, your %5$s, risks damaging a vital component. But man, you really need those pills.</string>
    <string name="choice_six">Alas, you have been so distracted by your favorite YouTube clips of half-%1$s super mutants hunting half-%2$s mutants that you\'ve neglected the %3$s!\n\nThe emotional trauma of neglect aside, its physical situation is dire. You <i>might</i> be able to avert damage by appropriating some parts from other components, though you know what mother might have said about theft had she not been a kleptomaniac.</string>
    <string name="choice_seven">Walnuts! You\'ve knocked over your rejuvenation juice again! Its sickly viscous texture does wonders for coating your perforated innards, but is less kind to the machinery in front of you. Sensors beep wildly, and it appears that damage to the %1$s is impending. Would you like to try injecting bleach into the affected area?</string>
    <string name="choice_eight">The voices are back. Burning through your mind like field of hippie draft cards, they compel you to act.\n\nFortunately, much of your electricity grid runs through a local community center, and you could channel some of your machine\'s power into blowing up the group of %1$s that meet there weekly. That should satisfy the bloodlust, though the diversion of power might damage one of your components.</string>


    <!--Second tier of choices, roll to avoid negative. Roll cases 10-19.-->
    <string name="choice_ten">Force of time, force of wear. Your head splits sideways with sleep and sustenance deprived agony. There is %1$s called <i>%2$s</i> that you learned long ago but never sufficiently practiced. Would you like to try it?
    </string>
    <string name="choice_eleven">Gads! The %1$s has developed %2$s and is threatening to siphon some of your offshore wealth to pay for its grid therapy! Is this even real life?\n\nAs a former psychology major, you may be able to talk some sense into the thing, though your skills are quite rusty.</string>
    <string name="choice_twelve">The %1$s is sick and tired of being overworked, unappreciated, and paid in bottle caps. It roars its discontent, shaking your walls and calling no small amount of attention to your evil plans.\n\nYou may be able to quiet its demands with empty promises of trinkets and swamp drainage, though the effort may take a lot out of you.</string>
    <!--Roll for no loss choice events.-->
    <string name="choice_thirteen">Gadzooks! A %1$s of %2$s has somehow gotten into the %3$s, threatening the %4$s! You may be able to draw them out with your trusty %5$s, though that would risk damaging something else.</string>
    <string name="choice_fourteen">With all the chaos surrounding your day to day endeavors, you have forgotten to pay your %1$s bill! And by \"pay,\" we mean divert massive, small-country-sustaining funds from offshore corporate dummy accounts.\n\nYour operation requires a very delicately balanced set of books, lest the whole thing risk crashing down. You can attempt to haggle with the mafia middle men who streamline the process, or simply pay an exorbitant late fee.</string>
    <string name="choice_fifteen">Your %1$s is calling on line %2$s. They are not one to take \"no\" for an answer, and despite your callous, destructive, downright evil machinations, you always did have a soft spot for family.\n\nThe work you are doing at the moment is highly crucial, however, and interrupting it is certain to damage something. You may be able to talk your away into an early release, though with your %3$s that always carries a risk.</string>
    <string name="choice_sixteen">A rapping at your chamber door! How on Gazorpazorp\'s scorched earth did anyone find your hidden enclave? Your Zoom-O surveillance unit shows a %1$s of %2$s waiting patiently outside. Tenacious bastards, those ones.\n\nWell, you need them gone one way or the other. Bribes or bees, which will it be?</string>
    <string name="choice_seventeen">The sleepless nights drag on, and you can feel your body paying the price. An experimental concoction of %1$s straight out of %2$s has recently come to your attention, and while it comes with free home delivery and an anonymity guarantee, it is obscenely expensive. Oh, what to do? </string>
    <string name="choice_eighteen">A flurry of %1$s %2$s are flying off the %3$s. At this rate, the %4$s will be damaged soon.\n\nYou feel as if you could patch up the damage, though it will require a very expensive piece of black market uranium, drone-dropped by <i>Amazon Prime\'s</i> dark web subsidiary, <i>Amazon Crime</i>.\n\nYou <i>may</i> have a credit from the %5$s you returned last month. Anyway, no time to check!</string>

    <!--Fourth tier, roll for positive-, Run cases 20-29-->
    <string name="choice_twenty">The %1$s that you are tapping is currently supplying you with more power than necessary at the moment. You may be able to repair one of your construction components by diverting some of the power to an insufficiently tested %2$s, if you dare.</string>
    <string name="choice_twentyOne">After another endless expanse of time in a seemingly infinite loop of Sisyphean exertion, you happen to spy %1$s affectionately titled %2$s\n\nOh, how you long for the days when your hobbies were confined to Facebook wars, small group torture and a good book. Perhaps revisiting the latter would be rejuvenating.</string>
    <string name="choice_twentyTwo">Another day, another several million dollars in illegally laundered cash. You are deep in thoughts and prayers, minding your own world-dominating business, when you suddenly feel an unsettling %1$s near your %2$s.\n\nWhat\'s that, %3$s? You  have created a new %4$s for me to try? Oh, lovely, you shouldn\'t have! Oh, you would like me to test it right now?</string>
    <string name="choice_twentyThree">An old-timey musical hiss emanates from your %1$s. You do not own or possess %2$s, though this fact disturbs you less than you would expect it to. The sound hearkens back to a long-forgotten %3$s. Memories flood past in an unbridled wash of nostalgia, softening your thick skin and kindling what the kids would call \"emotional availability.\"\n\nFor a brief moment, your eyes meet the mutant mess of miscreant monstrosity that oozes in various gel-like states all around you. It is a heartfelt, touching moment, that you may elect to explorer further.</string>

    <!--Non-choice Events. Roll cases 30-39.-->
    <string name="event_one">Distress sirens blare like spastic foghorns from all corners of the room as %1$s %2$s out of the %3$s. You try to react, but are too late, and the %4$s is damaged. </string>
    <string name="event_two">Your palms are sweaty, your head grows heavy, and mom isn\'t making anymore spaghetti. Not since the accident. The inhumane, exertive pressures of your burden have notched another victory against your %1$s.
    </string>
    <string name="event_three">An anguished cry pours forth from the incinerator. Wretched beast - it was supposed to be dead! Burnt! Annihilated!\n\nThe screams are inhuman, obviously, both in pitch and volume, and even the triple-insulated nano-plexiglas soundproofing your lair is unable to contains the cacophony of primal suffering. Though it has likely scared any daytime explorers away, the outcry is all the more likely to call attention to you.</string>
    <string name="event_four">The fix is in at the %1$s races this week, and that tip you got from %2$s has fallen flat! Who would have thought a champion with the name \"%3$s\" would turn out to be a total flop? You make a mental note to bet less next time, or possibly just do due diligence. Is not betting an option? </string>

    <string name="extra_one">Would you like to fight %1$s for money? Don\'t think about the logistics too much.</string>
    <string name="extra_two">Feeling a little tuckered? Would you like to try a new workout based on the science of %1$s? I\'m sure your mind can handle it.</string>
    <string name="extra_three">Feeling a bit kooky? Care to attempt some homespun electroshock therapy? Remember, this is <i>your</i> home, not some kid with a couple of wires.</string>
    <string name="extra_four">Just because you\'re paranoid doesn\'t mean they\'re not watching you, right? Perhaps it would be a good idea to send your robotic doppelganger out for a bit to mingle, just to assure the public that everything is just peachy down here.</string>

    <string name="extra_five">A crusty red demon, about the size of a Chucky doll and adorned with all the stereotypical trappings of a bad Krampus rendering lands by your feet. This seems oddly familiar, though the much of your recent memory is a fragmented jumble.\n\n\"A deal! A deal!\" it squeals in delight. \"A piece of every part of you, in exchange for your machine\'s transcendence! Yes, yes!\"\n\nMother warned to never trust devils, though you are fairly sure she was referring to your dad, for whom you could say the same about. The imp taps its fiery foot impatiently. </string>

    <string name="extra_six">A thick red gel oozes up from a thousand nascent micro-cracks in your floor, coalescing into an amorphously billowy, corpulent mass of undulating flesh. This seems oddly familiar, though the much of your recent memory is a fragmented jumble.\n\n\"A deal!\" it bellows through a thick, lispy phlegm. \"A limitless thing, for a piece of your most beloved! Choose!\"</string>

    <string name="extra_seven">Despite an abundance of cautionary measures, including the sacrifice of several neighborhood strays, your Sterile-B-Good virus detector has picked up - you guessed it- a virus. This particular one threatens to eat away at %1$s. It will require a substantial investment of resources to eradicate it. </string>

    <string name="extra_eight">\"Hey, %1$s!\ Yeah, I\'m talking to you!\"\n\nYour %2$s has apparently gained the power of linguistic communication.\n\n\"I\'m bored, cranky, and I don\'t particularly like you. Sing me a song or I\'m gonna cause some trouble before going mute again for a while.\"\n\nWell, you heard the thing.</string>
    <string name="extra_nine_good">A genie appears! Apparently you were rubbing what you <i>thought</i> was something else, but was in fact a magic bottle.\n\n\"Lo, mortal! I am a beneficent spirit, and I will heal a part of your device. Which will it be?\n\nWell, aren\'t we a lucky one today! </string>
    <string name="extra_nine_bad">A genie appears! Apparently you were rubbing what you <i>thought</i> was something else, but was in fact a magic bottle.\n\n\"Lo, mortal! I am not one of those goodie two-shoes, humanitarian spirits. For disturbing my repose, I will damage a part of your machine. Choose!\"\n\nAh, nuts.</string>
    <string name="extra_ten">Sometimes, you really loathe yourself. This moment is one of those times. You have an irresistible urge to watch two of your machine\'s components battle each other for your amusement.\n\nYou realize this is terribly detrimental to your life, legacy, and likely freedom, but there is almost certainly no resisting the compulsion.</string>
    <string name="extra_eleven">Your late night virtual reality %1$s sessions have drawn a critical mass of power away from your machine! It looks like the %2$s will be damaged shortly, though you can flood it with extra power at the expense of another component, if you wish. This is how science works, folks. </string>
    <string name="extra_twelve">The ancient Indian burial ground your laboratory is built on bubbles up like an ethereal volcano, releasing the spirits of exploited indigenous persons into your lair. This happens every so often, unfortunately.\n\nYou know they will not leave without sacrificing at least some of your machine to atone for centuries of war crimes. They have narrowed it down to the %1$s or the %2$s, so which will it be?</string>
    <string name="extra_thirteen">High stakes %1$s is the newest rage among compulsive online gamblers, and you have a free moment to spare. Would you like to try your luck?</string>

    <string name="post_upgrade">With all of your machine components upgraded to their present capacity, there is the opportunity for a majestic ascension or a shameful fall from grace. Again, this is how science works.\n\nYou may choose as many or as few components as you would like. Do tread lightly when playing this close to the sun though, yeah?</string>
    <string name="post_upgrade_roll">You throw your machine\'s fate into the grasping hands of the gods…</string>
    <string name="post_upgrade_no">You decide not to risk any of your machine\'s components.</string>
    <string name="post_upgrade_result">The Strength Infuser has %1$s.\n\nThe Dexterity Animator has %2$s.\n\nThe Intelligence Designer has %3$s.\n\nThe Beauty Sculptor has %4$s.\n\nThe Loyalty Inculcator has %5$s.</string>

    <!--Strings for Choice Results-->
    <string name="result_one_yes">Your hands and feet jump into a whirlwind of flurry. Switches are felled and raised, knobs are turned, and levers are cranked. When dusk at last falls, you breathe a sigh of tearful, dissatisfied satisfaction as the %1$s takes damage instead. </string>
    <string name="result_one_no">Sometimes, one must simply accept his or her fate without interference. You choke a silent sob as the %1$s, as much your child as any flesh and blood could be, hurts for the worse.</string>
    <string name="result_two_yes">They say the greatest tragedy is when a parent outlives his child, which is why you decided to invest in the human extermination trade instead. Still, as the %1$s crumbles before your eyes, you kind of sort of get what they mean.
    </string>
    <string name="result_three_yes">Between beatings, mother often told you to carry your head high, suffer no shame, and live your life to its fullest potential. Well gosh darn it, if only her bludgeoned remains underneath your floor could see you now.\n\nNot content to allow harm to visit your life\'s work just for a bit of anonymity, you divert the excess energy. The resulting cacophonous clamor is severe indeed, and there is little doubt that anyone within an uncomfortable radius heard it loud and clear.</string>
    <string name="result_three_no">Not content to advertise yourself to the world just yet, you allow the %1$s to sacrifice itself for the greater good. There will be no medals, no parades, no Lifetime original movies starring %2$s and %3$s as the machine and you, but a quiet nobility rests here nonetheless. </string>
    <string name="result_four_success">Do all heroes wear capes? You don\'t know, having neither seen nor heard a spit of television, cinema, radio, or podcast in the past decade. What you do know is that for someone who is technically more formaldehyde and methamphetamine than man, you have managed to retrieve your pills without consequence. Huzzah. </string>
    <string name="result_four_failure">The good news is that your lifeblood (mind the misnomer, for naught but sickly sweet oil, liquor, and preservative have flowed through your veins for the past decade) has been retrieved. The bad news? Well, you knew it was coming. The process was not kind to the %1$s, which has taken damage.</string>
    <string name="result_four_no">Where is the emoji for crumbling old mad scientist? Is this some Apple ageist huffle buffle? You make a mental note to write a letter to Steve Jobs. Is it still Steve Jobs? You need to get out more.\n\nUnfortunately, without your pills your body continues to wither away.</string>
    <string name="result_five">The choice is made. The damage is done. The life of the person that is you goes on.</string>
    <string name="result_five_save">My gods, brave one! Who knows how the universe turns with such fearless, delusional resolve! Whatever angelic or demonic power heard you, heard you well. The inevitable damage has been averted, and you grow stronger in the knowledge that sometimes the uncontrollable can be controlled.</string>
    <string name="result_five_fail">What did you think would happen with this gambit, man-child? Alas, the apparent expectation of screaming helplessly into an indifferent universal void versus its reality has cost you a bit of your own mind.</string>
    <string name="result_six_yes_success">Fortune has truly smiled upon you on this blessed and most holy of days. You managed to pluck just the right amount of stuff from each constituent part, leaving them either none the wiser or not quite wanting enough to suffer ill effects. </string>
    <string name="result_six_yes_failure">A little bit from you, a smidgen from you, and…oh, dear.\n\nEven in its rudimentary sentience, the %1$s notices you plucking away at its most valuable innards - really, the only thing it owns - and is more than a little miffed. It was already running in overdrive to cope with the missing parts, and decides to simply stop trying so hard. </string>
    <string name="result_six_no">You decide that one must face the consequences of his or her actions, especially when avoiding them involves potentially getting on the wrong side of a machine so powerful that it could likely devour your soul twice over if it so chose.\n\nDoes this mean you\'re growing as a person? You hope not.</string>
    <string name="result_seven_yes_success">Remarkably, and with a providence that borders on the divine, the disinfectant dilutes and diverts the juice in a way keeps it from damaging any vital parts of your machine. How lovely.\n\nYour absurd luck notwithstanding, this case study should be not taken as evidence that industrial grade poison should ever be injected as a curative measure. Who needs to be told that though, right?</string>
    <string name="result_seven_yes_failure">Well, who could have guessed that this would turn out poorly. Besides everyone. The disinfectant, rather than contain the damage, simply gets itself into all sorts of unnecessary places and makes the whole shebang worse. </string>
    <string name="result_seven_no">You decide that the risk of attempting an untried, untested, and almost certainly lethal Hail Mary curative is not the best course of action.</string>
    <string name="result_eight_yes_success">Your mission is simply too important to allow any interference, especially one so potent as screaming delusions. You flip a few switches, enter a few lines of code, and send a massive power surge to the precise location where innocence will soon die. And it does. And you\'re fine. Really, you are fine.</string>
    <string name="result_eight_yes_failure">Living is for the strong! Death is for the meek! At this point, you are unsure where the voices end and your own thoughts begin. You work yourself up into such a fervor that you accidentally carry an extra digit in your calculations, blowing up not only the intended target but also a sewer main and a flock of peace birds. Unfortunately, this left you with a critical shortage of power that damages your %1$s.\n\nIs there a lesson in all this? You hope not. </string>
    <string name="result_eight_no">Sometimes, in order to kill more, once must kill less. Is that the expression?\n\nThe consequence of this ostensibly moral choice is that your auditory delusions double down in their intensity, and it is all you can do to keep yourself from breaking.</string>


    <string name="result_ten_no">You decide it would be safer to leave well enough alone.</string>
    <string name="result_eleven_no">There is no shame in allowing a quasi-mechanical entity of ambivalent sentience to confront its demons at your expense. Maybe it will emerge more productive than ever. In the meantime, your bank bleeds.</string>
    <string name="result_twelve_no">What, are you the Socialist Republic of Handouts? At first it\'s just a trinket, but then it turns into voting rights and a living wage. The damn thing doesn\'t even breathe, unless you count the pitched wheezing of various expulsion tubes. Hush, you damnable amalgamation of slithering insubordination!</string>
    <string name="result_twelve_no_good">Fortunately, it seems to have tired itself out and is no longer drawing attention to you.</string>
    <string name="result_twelve_no_bad">Unfortunately, the wailing continues for quite some time, and you are now more conspicuous than before.</string>
    <string name="result_thirteen_no">You decide to let the critters have their new home. What\'s a few million dollars worth of damage when weighed against the wrath of PETA?</string>
    <string name="result_fourteen_no">%1$s does not have a kind reputation, and you have grown rather accustomed to having kneecaps. You decide to bear the consequences of your oversight and cough up the funds. </string>
    <string name="result_fifteen_no">You\'ve seen dangers. You\'ve been in the wars. You\'ve knocked a silly man\'s sillier hat off his silliest head. There are some battles you will not pick, however, and this is one of them. Consequently, by the time you get off the phone, your wits are addled.</string>
    <string name="result_twenty_no">You have made enough terrible decisions in this life to realize when a looming temptation can seem so plausible in the moment, but idiotic in retrospect. You have determined this is one of those times.</string>
    <string name="result_twentyOne_no">There can be danger in knowledge, especially when one is so inundated with other concerns as to find him or herself on the precipice of a torrential flood. You have no need to tempt a psychotic state at this moment.</string>
    <string name="result_twentyTwo_no">Though temptation is strong, you are stronger still. The device is scrapped.</string>
    <string name="result_twentyThree_no">You keep yourself at arm\'s distance, and feel all the safer for it.</string>
    <string name="result_extraOne_1">Such valor! Such bravery! Such pain!</string>
    <string name="result_extraOne_2">You\'re hurt, but the purse came through.</string>
    <string name="result_extraOne_3">Fly like a butterfly and sting like a bee, baby. I don\'t know how you did it.</string>

    <string name="result_extraTwo_1">When novel exertion meets the troubled mind, who is left to pick up the pieces?</string>
    <string name="result_extraTwo_2">Better. Stronger. More Powerful. Definitely more insane.</string>
    <string name="result_extraTwo_3">All of the perks and none of the dregs. Happy you.</string>

    <string name="result_extraThree_1">That was never going to go well, and now everything hurts. Sorry.</string>
    <string name="result_extraThree_2">It was painful. It was exhausting. It was liberating. Worth it? Well, you\'re no philosopher.</string>
    <string name="result_extraThree_3">Well, that went quite swimmingly. Almost suspiciously so.</string>

    <string name="result_extraFour_1">Why didn\'t you just put a up a flashing billboard advertising your nefarious doings? Now they probably also think you\'re one of those weird doll people, too.</string>
    <string name="result_extraFour_2">The good news is your doppelganger socialized very well and has certainly assuaged some of the suspicions your neighbors may have had. The bad news is it felt pressured to write a large check to the local PTA.</string>
    <string name="result_extraFour_3">Your doppelganger socialized extremely well, so well in fact that you are briefly consumed with a terrible jealousy at its interpersonal coping skills. In any case, it has certainly assuaged some of the suspicions your neighbors may have had.</string>

    <string name="result_extra_five_yes">A vicious grin streaks across the creature\'s face, and its body trembles as if its sinews were being pulled taut.\n\nAt once your vision begins to blur, head throbbing like an abused snare drum. You focus, trying to quell the panic and awaiting the fallout from your Faustian bargain. The room spins, the walls bleed, and you fall to the floor in a screaming, crumpled heap.\n\nYou awake in a painful haze. The demon is gone, and so is much of you. In a panic, you pour over the components of your machine. You realize that the %1$s is somehow, in a way that defies even your stretched boundaries of physics, engineered to produce perfection.
    </string>
    <string name="result_extra_five_no">The creature huffs and puffs, stamping its feet in a pre-tantrum dance before leaping up and slapping you across the face. By the time you wipe the tears away, it is nowhere to be seen.</string>

    <string name="result_extra_six_yes">The demon grins wide, exposing two quad sets of interlocking, impeccably white fangs against the backdrop of a thick black abyss. The room spins, spins faster, and then goes dark.\n\nUpon awakening,</string>
    <string name="result_extra_san">your head and heart feel like smooth stone, forever passed over by the current of life\'s woes but never shaken. It is only when you turn back to your machine that you realize it has been stripped dearly.</string>
    <string name="result_extra_end">you feel your body rejuvenated in a way long forgotten, as if youth and vigor themselves have made their home within you. It is only when you turn back to your machine that you realize it has been stripped dearly.</string>
    <string name="result_extra_wealth">you are greeted with beeping bank alerts galore, and your jaw drops at the ridiculous influx of cash into your accounts. It is only when you turn back to your machine that you realize it has been stripped dearly.</string>
    <string name="result_extra_anon">you notice an eerie silence about the room. Checking your Zoom-O surveillance unit\'s reverse-pan footage, you see nothing where your laboratory should be other than a faint shimmer, the type that any innocuous reflection of light might give. It is only when you turn back to your machine that you realize it has been stripped dearly. </string>

    <string name="result_extra_six_no">You decide that there is room but for one foul presence in this place, and dismiss the demon with a casual arrogance. It growls like a drowning banshee, spits in your face, and dissolves itself back underground. Great, now you have to mop.</string>

    <string name="result_extra_seven_yes">Realizing that long term success requires short term sacrifice, you spend the next week scrubbing, shouting, crying, and generally having an unpleasant time of it. When the dust settles, you are safe from the infection.</string>
    <string name="result_extra_seven_no">Unwilling to sacrifice so much so quickly, you content yourself with sharing your home with the microscopic entity for the foreseeable future.</string>
    <string name="result_extra_no">And the days march on…</string>

    <string name="result_extra_eight_success">What\'s a bit of music to keep things running smoothly? You dust off the old %1$s, belt out a sweet tune, and are satisfied to see the %2$s fade back into a silent lack of sentience. Well, how easy was that.</string>
    <string name="result_extra_eight_failure">What\'s a bit of music to keep things running smoothly? Unfortunately, the only instrument you can locate at the moment is a %1$s, and there is only so much a fair tenor like yourself can do with such wanting accoutrements. The %2$s is very displeased and not a little bit traumatized, banging its internal circuitry around to its own detriment.</string>
    <string name="result_extra_eight_no">"\You must have a lot of friends who make idle threats!\" it screeches, before proceeding to beat the bejesus out of the %1$s.</string>

    <string name="result_extra_good_nine">The genie nods, lifts up its hands in a whirling dervish of flurry, and when the smokes clears your %1$s looks spiffier than before. Well, wasn\'t that easy!</string>
    <string name="result_extra_good_nine_failure">The genie nods, lifts up its hands in a whirling dervish of flurry, and when the smokes clears your %1$s looks…exactly the same as before. The genie shrugs and disappears.</string>
    <string name="result_extra_bad_nine">The genie nods, lifts up its hands in a whirling dervish of flurry, and when the smokes clears your %1$s creaks and moans with a newfound malfunction. Great.</string>
    <string name="result_extra_ten_yes">Thy obsession\'s will be done…\n\nThe %1$s and the %2$s battle it out fiercely, and by the end of the bloody struggle the %3$s is much worse for the wear. </string>
    <string name="result_extra_ten_no">You refuse to be a slave to maladaptive mental malfeasance! The struggle is long, hard fought and ultimately successful, but boy did it take something out of you.</string>
    <string name="result_extra_eleven_yes">You decide that a sacrifice to save the %1$s is worth it, and the sacrifice is grave indeed as the %2$s wails with pain.</string>
    <string name="result_extra_eleven_no">You are not willing to pick out a poor random component to fall on the sword. What is this, Roman decimation? The %1$s whimpers and loses some of its functionality.</string>
    <string name="result_extra_twelve_yes">With no choice in the matter, you offer up the %1$s. Poor thing, it was just a boy!</string>
    <string name="result_extra_twelve_no">With no choice in the matter, you offer up the %1$s. Poor thing, it was just a boy!</string>
    <string name="result_extra_thirteen_yes_success">Success!</string>
    <string name="result_extra_thirteen_yes_failure">Crushing defeat. At least you didn\'t bet the bunker.</string>
    <string name="result_extra_thirteen_no">You decide to focus on more important matters. You know, like the monstrosity maker in front of you.</string>


    <string name="result_ten_yes_success">The Qi flows into the Zen which flows again into the spiritual awakening centered on something very profound. You don\'t really care, as long as it works. Which it does. You feel your %1$s strengthen.</string>
    <string name="result_ten_yes_failure">Perhaps Mercury is not in retrograde, the stars are unaligned, or the chili you\'ve eaten for the past 6 nights is finally catching up. In any event, your attempt to expel that which haunts you is a dismal failure, which ironically causes you only more distress. </string>
    <string name="result_eleven_yes_success">\"So you see, child, the \'id\' cannot unduly influence one\'s psyche without the express permission of the \'ego\', which in turn is further regulated by the \'super-ego\'…\n\nThough you are unsure of how deeply the ambivalently sentient device is able to comprehend your lecture, it nonetheless seems to respond positively. After a time, the worst of its nihilistic venting has ceased.

It seems the regular ones just aren\'t doing it for those stallions, anymore. </string>

The poor thing falls in a hail of angry gunfire.</string>

    <string name="interlude">Your little excursion at an end, you admonish the beast to carry out its final charge and extract the maximum value for your valiant efforts…</string>

    <string name="summary_one">Your creation\'s path of destruction has struck terror into the hearts of %1$s of the population, cowing them before you. Its intellectual prowess and aesthetic charm has swayed the hearts and minds of %2$s.</string>
